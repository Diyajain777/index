      <h1> What is Immersive Technology?</h1><br>
      <h2>Immersive Technology is any technology that extends reality or creates a new reality by leveraging the 360 space. Because Immersive Technology leverages the 360 space/sphere, users can look in any direction and see content. Some types of Immersive Technology extend reality by overlaying digital images on a user’s environment. Others create a new reality by completely shutting a user out from the rest of the world and immersing them in a digital environment.</h2><h2>

          </h2><h1> What are Different Types of Immersive Technology?</h1><h1>
              </h1><h2> The different types of Immersive Technology are 360, VR, AR, MR, and XR:</h2><h2>
                  <br>
                  </h2><h1>360</h1><h1>
                      </h1><h3>360 is the most basic and probably the most familiar immersive technology out there. These days, 360 content can be seen practically anywhere online – especially on YouTube and Facebook. Most modern smartphones will also enable you to create a 360 image by using the “photo sphere” feature so citizen creators also have the ability to relatively quickly create 360 degree images of wherever you are or whatever you want to show people! Similarly, the cost of the equipment to create 360 imagery has also gone down considerably. The 360 content found in on social platforms like You Tube and Facebook range from user-generated to brand-sponsored content. No surprise there as this new format gives content creators more space to work with and allows users to explore content by looking in any direction.</h3><h3>
                          <br>
                          </h3><h1>AR</h1><h1>
                              </h1><h3>Augmented Reality (AR) is a different type of Immersive Technology where digital images are presented on top of the real world. This means that users who leverage AR aren’t completely shut off from the world. Instead, AR extends their reality. A great example of AR is Snapchat Filters. With Snapchat Filters you can overlay digital images of a puppy, cat, movie star, etc. onto your face. You can even move your phone around and see clouds around you or stars. Another familiar example is Pokemon Go where users can walk around their neighborhood with their mobile phones and find Pokemon that are overlaid on the environment around the user. Even stores like Target and Ikea have their own AR apps where users can choose a product (like a piece of furniture) and place it virtually in their homes. This enables them to test out how products look with their other furniture or even provide an idea of how big the piece of furniture is going to be. Essentially, it allows consumers to “try out” a product before even buying it.
                                </h3><h3>
                                  <br>
                                  </h3><h1>VR</h1><h1>
                                      </h1><h3>Virtual Reality is another very familiar type of immersive technology, especially because it has been quite the buzzword for the last couple of years. With VR, a user is completely shut out from the rest of the world while being surrounded by content. Through a head mounted display (HMD), whatever content the user experiences in the headset becomes their “reality” – allowing users to experience real and imagined worlds as if they are really there.</h3><h3>
